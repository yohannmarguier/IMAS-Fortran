! The hand-authored rule table for the shim contract suite's structural rules.
!
! The conversion map this table transcribes lives in the shim's own repository
! at docs/3.39.0--4.1.1.xml (IMAS-Multiversion-DD-Loader), not in this one. It
! is hand-authored here rather than generated from that file because the map
! itself says why generation would silently under-cover: it opens with
!
!   <include href="../common/error-model-3to4.xml"/>
!   <include href="../common/naming-3to4.xml"/>
!
! and neither `common/error-model-3to4.xml` nor `common/naming-3to4.xml`
! exists anywhere the map is reachable from outside the shim's own tree. The
! second one is the one that matters here: it is the include the map's own
! comments say carries the common cross-IDS renames, so a generator walking
! only what resolves would produce a table that looks complete while quietly
! missing an entire rename family. A hand-authored table fails to compile
! instead of failing to notice.
!
! Promoting a flattened, machine-readable rule manifest — so a table like this
! one could be generated and checked against it instead of merely trusted —
! is recorded here as an ask of the shim, alongside the loss-log-format ask
! docs/adr/0002 already names; both are to be gathered into the suite's own
! README (#78) once it lands.
!
! Every entry below cites either a rule id from that map or a section of
! imas-python-fixtures/README.md, so an entry can be checked without reading
! the shim's implementation. This module carries the kinds whose verdict is
! "the two sides agree" and whose subject matter is structural: identical,
! renamed, moved, merged (the eight folds where both DD3 spellings carry
! real data) and split — plus, per ticket #68, every COCOS 11 -> 17 sign
! flip the map declares. Right_only has its own verdict and belongs to
! ticket #69.
!
! The paths the shim refuses to serve have landed here too, in
! `refusal_rules` below (#70). They share this module because they share its
! shape and its citation discipline, and they are a separate table because a
! refusal is in play for each of them -- correctly for the one `retyped`
! rule, and wrongly for the four unit-`redefined` ones, which are red by
! design until the shim serves them.
!
! Five further `merged` rules exist in the map (fold-constraints-j,
! fold-ggd-j, fold-ggd-bfield, fold-p1d-j, fold-p2d-j) whose only real DD3
! source is the deprecated `_tor` alias — imas-python-fixtures/README.md's
! own "Renames" table lists their targets alongside true renames for that
! reason. Two of those five targets (profiles_1d/j_phi, profiles_2d/j_phi)
! are themselves COCOS paths and are carried below as cocos rules, each
! noting the fold it also rides on; the remaining three are not claimed by
! any rule-table ticket today. That gap is noted here rather than silently
! widening this table's scope to cover it.
!
! ------------------------------------------------------------ COCOS 11 -> 17
!
! Source of truth: IMAS-Multiversion-DD-Loader's docs/3.39.0--4.1.1.xml,
! <transforms><cocos from="11" to="17">...</cocos></transforms>. That block
! lists exactly 30 <flip path="..."/> entries today, each transcribed below
! citing its own path — not 32. imas-python-fixtures/README.md's "COCOS 11 ->
! 17" section and this repository's parent spec (issue #63) both say "32
! paths in the map's <cocos> block"; every commit that has ever touched that
! file (c0beaaf, 333996f, 6a87941, 2022a17) carries the same 30, so 32 looks
! like a stale count rather than a moving target. This table follows the map
! itself rather than the stale count, per this suite's own design principle:
! a hand-authored table fails to compile instead of failing to notice, and
! silently padding it to 32 would be worse than either — it would assert
! agreement on a path nobody's fixture or map actually flips.
!
! Two paths outside the <cocos> block are deliberately not carried here even
! though they are also negated:
!
!   - `time_slice/constraints/j_parallel/position/psi` — flipped by
!     equilibrium_v4_1_1.py for the fixture's own physical self-consistency,
!     but the whole `constraints/j_parallel` subtree is `right_only` (rule
!     "new-constraints-j-parallel": DD3 has no j_parallel constraint at all),
!     so the shim never converts a DD3 value into it. It belongs to the
!     right_only rule kind, not this one.
!   - `time_slice/contour_tree/node/psi` — the fixtures README's own "COCOS
!     11 -> 17" section names this as one quantity outside the map that is
!     "also negated", since `contour_tree` has no DD3 source at all
!     (`new-contour-tree`, right_only). Same reasoning as above.
!
! `global_quantities/psi_magnetic_axis` is both a cocos rule here and the
! split-psi-axis structural rule above: the map's own <flip> entry for it
! carries `note="target of split-psi-axis"`, and both are worth asserting
! independently rather than assuming one implies the other.
! `profiles_1d/j_phi` and `profiles_2d/j_phi` are similarly both a cocos rule
! here and (per the note above) an obsolescent-alias fold not otherwise
! claimed by the structural table.

  ! The paths the shim refuses to serve today.
  !
  ! That is what collects these five entries: the refusal is an observation
  ! about current behaviour, not the expectation. The expectation differs per
  ! kind, and for four of the five the refusal is itself the defect:
  !
  !   retyped   -- the refusal is correct. No value transformation reshapes
  !                an INT_1D into an array of identifier structures, so the
  !                path genuinely cannot be served and the expected verdict
  !                is a tolerated refusal.
  !   redefined -- the refusal is wrong, and these entries are RED BY DESIGN
  !                until the shim is fixed. The map marks the four
  !                chi_squared paths fidelity="unmappable"; that marking is
  !                the defect. Both dictionaries hold the same number
  !                (imas-python-fixtures/README.md, "Redefinitions the map
  !                refuses", writes the DD 3 number unchanged into both
  !                fixtures), so the expected verdict is that the two sides
  !                agree, and the assertion says so rather than recording
  !                what the shim does today.
  !
  ! Per docs/adr/0002, a contract assertion is not inverted, quarantined or
  ! weakened to match observed behaviour: the four reds turn green by
  ! themselves when the shim serves these paths, with nobody having to
  ! remember to come back and flip an expectation. ADR 0002's Consequences
  ! already lists these four among the suite's expected failures on arrival.
