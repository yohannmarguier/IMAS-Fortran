! Assert the rules the conversion map refuses, and assert that a refusal
! arrives on all three of the channels that carry one.
!
! A refusal, a tolerated refusal and a partial outcome are three distinct
! things travelling on three different channels, and a suite that checked only
! one of them would pass while the other two were silently broken:
!
!   1. the value channel  -- the field is left unset, so a caller sees an
!      absent quantity rather than a converted one or a defaulted zero;
!   2. the skip log       -- al_get_policy names the refused path, so the
!      refusal is discoverable rather than merely survivable;
!   3. the status         -- ids_get returns PARTIAL_READ, so a caller's
!      `status .ne. 0` test fires.
!
! Tolerating a refusal without reporting it is therefore a failure here, not a
! success: a read that left the field unset, continued to the end and returned
! 0 would satisfy channel 1 and fail channels 2 and 3.
!
! The rules asserted are the map's one `retyped` rule and its four unit
! `redefine` globs (shim_rule_table's `refusal_rules`), and the check that
! matters most is the negative one -- that no value arrives. For the four
! redefined paths the two fixtures hold the *same number* by construction
! (imas-python-fixtures/README.md, "Redefinitions the map refuses"), because
! a redefinition has nothing to apply. A shim that passed the DD 3 number
! through would therefore look perfect to a value comparison while handing a
! physicist a number that no longer means what its label says. What separates
! the two is the absence of the value plus a named entry in the skip log,
! which is why every rule below is asserted on both.
!
! Argument order is load-bearing. The comparison primitives name their absent
! side `only3` / `only4`, so the DD 4.1.1 control read is passed FIRST and the
! shim's cross-version read SECOND; a served-nothing then reads as `only4`,
! which is the verdict shim_rule_table expects for both refusal kinds.
!
! A failing check names the rule that broke -- id, kind and cited source --
! not only the field.
!
! FOUR OF THESE ASSERTIONS ARE RED ON ARRIVAL, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
!
! The four `chi_squared_{r,z}` paths are refused by the shim today, and the
! conversion map marks them fidelity="unmappable" to say so. That marking is
! the defect. Both dictionaries hold the same number -- there is nothing to
! apply to a redefinition, so imas-python-fixtures writes the DD 3 number
! unchanged into both fixtures -- so the number should be delivered, and this
! test asserts that the two sides agree.
!
! It therefore fails until the shim stops refusing them. Per docs/adr/0002 the
! assertion is not inverted with WILL_FAIL, not moved out of the default run
! and not softened to match what the shim does: all three would make the suite
! green while the defect stands, and someone would have to remember to come
! back and flip it. As written it turns green by itself when the shim is
! fixed. ADR 0002's Consequences already lists these four paths among the
! suite's expected failures on arrival, and #72 tracks the fix.
!
! The `retyped` rule above them is the opposite case: its refusal is correct,
! because no value transformation reshapes an INT_1D into an array of
! identifier structures, and it is asserted as a tolerated refusal.
