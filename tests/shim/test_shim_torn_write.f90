! Behaviour pin (issue #74), not a contract assertion: this is an accepted
! limitation, not a bug to fix.  A DD 4-only leaf in a DD 3 occurrence is
! refused, yet put_slice carries on.  IMAS-Fortran has no rollback, so the
! slice remains torn: its container grows and earlier leaves remain readable.
!
! The write policy exposes only a refusal count today.  check_torn_write.cmake
! therefore asserts the printed refused path; replace that weak seam with a
! structured write-path accessor mirroring al_get_policy's read-side accessor
! when one is added (the follow-up requested by issue #74).
