! Assert, per rule rather than per leaf, that every `right_only` rule in
! shim_rule_table yields a value on the DD 4 side only when:
!
!   - a DD 3.39.0 pulse is read via a DD 4.1.1 HLI through the shim, and
!   - the DD 4.1.1 fixture is read directly, same-version, plain passthrough.
!
! These are the paths DD 4 introduced with nothing on the DD 3 side to build
! them from. Serving nothing is therefore the correct behaviour, and this
! program asserts it rather than treating it as a defect.
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Argument order matters here, and only here.
!
! The comparison primitives take the DD 4 side first and the shim-served side
! second. With that order a served-nothing reading comes back `only4` — "the
! DD 4 oracle has a value, the shim served nothing" — which is the verdict
! `expected_verdict_for_kind(rule_kind_right_only)` requires. Passing the two
! reads the other way round reports `only3` for the same reading and every
! assertion below would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the
! shim. test_shim_structural_rules passes them in the opposite order, which
! does not change whether it passes — every verdict it expects is `same`, and
! the primitives reach `same` symmetrically — but it does change how it reads
! when it fails: a structural rule the shim served nothing for prints `only3`,
! "a value on the DD 3 side only", for a reading where the value is in fact on
! the DD 4 side. That is a legibility defect in a failure message rather than
! a wrong result, and it belongs to that test rather than this one.
!
! This is also why the loss log is a second channel rather than the only one:
! a value comparison on its own distinguishes a served field from a refused
! one, provided the shim-read column is the second argument.
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! A failing check names the rule that broke (id, kind and cited source), not
! only the field.

  ! The hole this closes, demonstrated rather than asserted in prose.
  !
  ! Every `same` expectation elsewhere in this suite is only worth something
  ! if agreement is unreachable when the shim serves nothing. If it were
  ! reachable, a refusal would masquerade as a match and a shim that served
  ! nothing at all would satisfy every structural rule.
  !
  ! So: take a reading the assertions above have just established the shim
  ! serves nothing for, and put it through `agrees` — the same predicate every
  ! `check` above decides on — against the expectation carried by a real entry
  ! of the structural table. The expectation is fetched through
  ! expected_verdict_for_kind from `structural_rules(1)%kind` rather than
  ! written out here, so this demonstrates the rule the suite actually
  ! asserts, and follows it automatically if that mapping ever changes.
  !
  ! The first expectation keeps the demonstration honest — it fails if the
  ! reading is not in fact a served-nothing one, so this cannot pass
  ! vacuously. The second is the property itself.
  !
  ! The anchor is deliberately `global_quantities/rho_tor_boundary`, one of
  ! the eight rules that hold today, and it must stay one of those: anchoring
  ! it on one of the five documented reds would fail the first expectation and
  ! turn a real finding into a confusing demonstration failure. Note it is not
  ! `boundary/rho_tor`, which is a different path and one of the five.
