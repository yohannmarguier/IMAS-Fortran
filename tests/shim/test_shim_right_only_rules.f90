! Assert, per rule rather than per leaf, that every `right_only` rule in
! shim_rule_table yields a value on the DD 4 side only when:
!
!   - a DD 3.39.0 pulse is read via a DD 4.1.1 HLI through the shim, and
!   - the DD 4.1.1 fixture is read directly, same-version, plain passthrough.
!
! These are the paths DD 4 introduced with nothing on the DD 3 side to build
! them from. Serving nothing is therefore the correct behaviour, and this
! program asserts it rather than treating it as a defect.
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Which side is which decides every verdict here, so every side is named.
!
! A served-nothing reading is `only4` — "the DD 4 oracle has a value, the shim
! served nothing" — which is the verdict
! `expected_verdict_for_kind(rule_kind_right_only)` requires. Name the two
! readings the other way round and the same reading is `only3`, and every
! assertion below fails for a reason that has nothing to do with the shim.
!
! This program has always got that right, and used to be the only one that
! did: the comparison primitives took the sides positionally, and
! test_shim_structural_rules and test_shim_cocos_rules passed the shim-served
! reading first for every rule. Their expectations are all `same`, which the
! primitives reach symmetrically, so their pass/fail was unaffected and no
! assertion in the suite could notice — but each of their served-nothing
! readings reported `only3`, "a value on the DD 3 side only", for a reading
! whose value is on the DD 4 side, and that label went into
! tests/shim/README.md as the account of what the shim did. The primitives now
! reject a positional call, so `oracle=` and `converted=` are spelled at every
! call site in the suite and the compiler keeps the three programs consistent.
!
! This is also why the loss log file is a second channel rather than the only
! one: a value comparison on its own distinguishes a served field from a
! refused one, provided each side is named for what it is.
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! A failing check names the rule that broke (id, kind and cited source), not
! only the field.

  ! The hole this closes, demonstrated rather than asserted in prose.
  !
  ! Every `same` expectation elsewhere in this suite is only worth something
  ! if agreement is unreachable when the shim serves nothing. If it were
  ! reachable, a refusal would masquerade as a match and a shim that served
  ! nothing at all would satisfy every structural rule.
  !
  ! So: take a reading the assertions above have just established the shim
  ! serves nothing for, and put it through `agrees` — the same predicate every
  ! `check` above decides on — against the expectation carried by a real entry
  ! of the structural table. The expectation is fetched through
  ! expected_verdict_for_kind from `structural_rules(1)%kind` rather than
  ! written out here, so this demonstrates the rule the suite actually
  ! asserts, and follows it automatically if that mapping ever changes.
  !
  ! The first expectation keeps the demonstration honest — it fails if the
  ! reading is not in fact a served-nothing one, so this cannot pass
  ! vacuously. The second is the property itself.
  !
  ! The anchor must be a rule that holds today, or the first expectation fails
  ! and a real finding turns into a confusing demonstration failure on top of
  ! it. It was `global_quantities/rho_tor_boundary`, chosen when eight of the
  ! thirteen rules held; ten of them are red now, that path among them, and the
  ! demonstration was duly failing for the same single cause as the ten rather
  ! than demonstrating anything. It is now `profiles_1d/psi_norm`, one of the
  ! three that hold.
  !
  ! Those three are all array-valued, which is why the anchor is now judged
  ! with the vector primitive: no scalar `right_only` rule is served-nothing
  ! any more, so no scalar reading can carry this demonstration while the shim
  ! behaves as it does. If the remaining three ever go red as well, this
  ! demonstration has no anchor left and the first expectation says so rather
  ! than the property quietly ceasing to be checked.

  ! An array the shim served nothing for may come back either unassociated or

  ! holds no value, so reporting it as present would turn a served-nothing
  ! reading into a `SHAPE` verdict against a populated oracle rather than the
  ! `only4` the rule expects. `.and.` is not short-circuiting in Fortran, so
  ! the size test is nested inside the association test throughout.

  ! A boundary worth stating, because it is the array-valued form of the
