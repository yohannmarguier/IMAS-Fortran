! find_rule, and the first three their own check, identical but for the table
! searched, the marker printed and -- in the COCOS case -- one extra line of
! explanation.  Four copies of a lookup and three of a judgement is three
! chances for one of them to stop matching the others, which had already
! happened once: the structural test folded leaf verdicts against a literal
! 'same' while its own check derived the expectation from the rule's kind.
!
! rule_checker holds the table, the marker and the two counters, so a program
! states which rules it is asserting and against which channel, and the
! judging, the reporting and the "did every entry get checked" guard are
! written once.
!
! The counters stay public and are read directly by the programs: they mix
! rule checks with other assertions (a skip-log lookup, a demonstration) that
! this type has no business knowing about.
