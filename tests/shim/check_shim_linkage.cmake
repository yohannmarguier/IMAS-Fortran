# Fails unless the built HLI library records the multiversion shim as a dynamic

# The point is not that the library links *something*, but that the shim is
# visible in an ordinary dependency listing: it is what makes "is the shim in the
# call path" answerable at a glance instead of by reading the build files. A build
# that resolved the shim's symbols out of a static archive, or one whose link line
# was bypassed (see the NAG branch in the top-level CMakeLists.txt), would pass
# every functional test while showing nothing here.

# Invoked by tests/shim/CMakeLists.txt; every -D it needs is checked below.
